Overview
++++++++

The Nutanix Xi IoT platform delivers local compute and AI for IoT edge devices, converging the edge and cloud into one seamless data processing platform. The Xi IoT platform eliminates complexity, accelerates deployments, and elevates developers to focus on the business logic powering IoT applications and services. Now developers can use a low-code development platform to create application software via APIs instead of arduous programming methods.

**In this lab you’ll deploy an application called “Facefeed” using the Xi IoT SaaS control plane. The application and its data pipelines are deployed to a virtual Xi Edge device running as a virtual machine on your local cluster. This application ingests an RTSP video stream and uses machine learning to detect known faces.**
